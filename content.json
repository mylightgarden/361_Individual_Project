You physically can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at Instagram in the pool, so one of the biggest benefits of swimming is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for giving the mind time to power down from constant digital stimulation. Morrissey says, 'many people say that by simply being in the water they feel more relaxed and less stressed. Regular exercise helps reduce anxiety and depression, as it releases \"feel good\" hormones and keeps our brains working in a healthy way.'\n\nPlus, she suggests if you embrace wild swimming and not just in your local pool you can reap more rewards: 'Learning to swim can allow you the opportunity to swim in beautiful places outdoors which many people find to be memories they cherish.'\n\nResearch has found that hitting the pool was comparable to Yoga in terms of reducing anxiety and stress over a 12-week period. 2. It's Lower Impact Than Other Forms of Cardio: Sore knees and ankles a common complaint of yours? Well, know you're not alone. High-intensity workouts can exacerbate already aching joints (think running or super challenging cardio home workouts) but swapping a few sessions for some pool laps could do you the world of good. \n\n'A runner will exert anything from 5-10 times their body weight through their hips, ankles and knees,' Morrissey says. 'As water naturally holds you up, it can reduce your moving body weight by up to 90%, this reduces the stresses and impact on your joints, muscles and bones by the same 90%. Which is huge!'\n\n'Yes, running or cycling will usually burn more calories than swimming,' she continues. 'But swimming keeps your heart rate up without stressing your body.' This type of exercise is known as steady-state training and helps to build stamina. 3. It Can Reduce Stress: Exercise is a well-known mood booster, but did you know that another benefit of swimming is that it can help mitigate the effects of stress chemically, too?\n\nWhen you exercise, your body naturally reduces stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline whilst simultaneously creating feel-good endorphins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nature's mood lifters. If you're stuck between work and a stressed place, carve out some time to move, in the pool or otherwise.",
